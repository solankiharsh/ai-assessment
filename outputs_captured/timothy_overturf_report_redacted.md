### High Severity (4/5)

#### Hansueli Overturf's Extensive Prior Criminal and Regulatory History
**Severity: HIGH** | **Confidence: 95%**

Timothy Overturf's father has a documented 20+ year history of regulatory violations:

| Date | Action | Authority | Details |
|------|--------|-----------|---------|
| **October 2004** | 12 Felony Counts | California | Selling unregistered securities, fraud; settled for ~$420,000; charges dismissed December 2006 |
| **August 2011** | Desist and Refrain Order | CA Commissioner | Violations of Corporations Code §25401 (misleading statements) |

---

#### Association with Suspended Investment Adviser
**Severity: HIGH** | **Confidence: 95%**

Timothy Overturf knowingly allowed his father to provide investment advice and execute trades in client accounts while Hansueli was suspended by the State of California. Timothy granted Hansueli **limited power of attorney** over client accounts despite knowledge of the suspension and unauthorized trading activity. This represents deliberate facilitation of regulatory circumvention.

---

#### Fiduciary Duty Breach — Unauthorized Trading
**Severity: HIGH** | **Confidence: 93%**

The SEC alleges that Timothy Overturf and Sisu Capital engaged in unauthorized and unsuitable trades from December 2017 to at least May 2021, including:
- Investing client funds in a **thinly-traded bank stock** as part of an undisclosed strategy to facilitate Timothy's business partnership proposals to the bank
- Purchasing 2,300 additional shares of bank stock for a client who had **"specifically and repeatedly instructed otherwise"**
- Holding complex financial instruments intended for short-term use for extended periods

---

#### Young Age at Firm Founding During Father's Suspension Period
**Severity: HIGH** | **Confidence: 88%**

Timothy Overturf founded Sisu Capital, LLC at age 18 in 2013/2014—**precisely during the period when his father was suspended** by the State of California (November 2011-November 2014). This timing raises serious questions about whether the firm was established as a vehicle to circumvent the father's regulatory suspension.

---

#### Self-Dealing and Personal Enrichment
**Severity: HIGH** | **Confidence: 92%**

Beyond aggregate fee extraction, Timothy Overturf personally received "hundreds of thousands of dollars in owner draws and loans from Sisu Capital" during the period of alleged misconduct, suggesting systematic self-dealing at client expense.

---

#### Conflict of Interest — Undisclosed Investment Strategy
**Severity: HIGH** | **Confidence: 90%**

Client assets were allegedly used to advance Timothy Overturf's personal business objectives—accumulating shares in a thinly-traded bank to support business partnership proposals—rather than serving client interests.

---

### Medium Severity (3/5)

| Risk | Description | Confidence |
|------|-------------|------------|
| **Pending Federal Litigation** | Active case in N.D. California with trial scheduled for July 2026 | 95% |
| **Failure to Disclose Material Information** | Did not inform clients of father's suspension/disciplinary history | 95% |
| **Extended Duration of Misconduct** | 4+ years of alleged continuous violations suggests systemic failure | 90% |
| **Multiple Concurrent Investigations** | MDF Law conducting independent investigation | 85% |
| **Defunct Firm Status** | Sisu Capital closure coincides with misconduct period | 90% |
| **Current Non-Registration Status** | No longer registered as Investment Adviser Representative | 88% |
| **Widespread Media Coverage** | Reputational damage from public fraud allegations | 88% |
| **Conflicting Founding Dates** | Sources report 2013, 2014, and 1997 as founding dates | 85% |

## Key Findings

### Multi-Generational Fraud Pattern
The investigation reveals a **disturbing pattern of family-operated financial misconduct** spanning two decades. Hansueli Overturf's regulatory violations began in 2004 with felony charges, continued through multiple suspensions, and persisted through his son's firm until 2021. Timothy's decision to found Sisu Capital during his father's suspension, then grant him trading authority over client accounts, suggests deliberate coordination to circumvent regulatory bars.

### Regulatory Circumvention Architecture
The structure of Sisu Capital appears designed to enable a suspended adviser to continue operating:
1. **Timing**: Firm founded precisely during father's suspension period
2. **Mechanism**: Limited power of attorney granted to suspended individual
3. **Concealment**: Failure to disclose father's disciplinary history to clients
4. **Duration**: Pattern continued through second suspension period (2017-2019)

### Entity Proliferation and Name Confusion
The investigation identified **6+ unrelated "Sisu" entities** across multiple jurisdictions, creating significant due diligence challenges. This name commonality could inadvertently associate the subject's regulatory issues with legitimate businesses or allow the subject to benefit from confusion with reputable entities.
