## Executive Summary

### **CRITICAL RISK RATING**

This investigation reveals a **severe and multi-layered risk profile** for Timothy Overturf, the founder, owner, and CEO of the now-defunct investment advisory firm Sisu Capital, LLC (Mill Valley, California). The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed a federal civil complaint on August 1, 2023, alleging that Overturf systematically defrauded clients over a four-year period (December 2017–May 2021) by making unauthorized and unsuitable trades, extracting over $2 million in improper fees, and concealing the involvement of his father, Hansueli "Hans" Overturf—a serially suspended and previously criminally charged investment adviser—in client account management.

The most alarming finding is the **multi-generational pattern of securities fraud**: Hansueli Overturf's regulatory and criminal history spans nearly two decades (2004–2023), including twelve felony counts, multiple state suspensions, FINRA sanctions, and Desist and Refrain orders. Timothy founded Sisu Capital at age 18 during his father's first suspension period, raising serious questions about whether the firm was created as a vehicle to circumvent regulatory bars. The SEC case (3:23-cv-03855) remains active in the Northern District of California with a jury trial reset to July 27–31, 2026.

### Risk Debate Transcript

**PROPONENT:** The investigation findings raise serious concerns due to multiple critical red flags and regulatory violations involving Timothy Overturf and Sisu Capital, LLC. The SEC has filed a civil complaint alleging that Overturf breached fiduciary duties by engaging in unauthorized and unsuitable trades, making material misrepresentations to clients, and failing to disclose his father's suspension and disciplinary history. These allegations suggest intentional misconduct rather than mere negligence, especially given the cited violations of antifraud provisions under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

Moreover, Timothy Overturf knowingly allowed his father, Hansueli Overturf—who was suspended twice by the State of California from acting as an investment adviser—to trade in client accounts using limited power of attorney. This deliberate facilitation of unauthorized trading by a suspended individual indicates a serious governance failure and potential regulatory evasion. The fact that over $2 million in improper fees were withdrawn from client accounts, alongside personal enrichment by Timothy through owner draws and loans, points to significant financial harm and possible self-dealing.

Additional concerns stem from the timing and structure of the firm’s founding. Sisu Capital was established by Timothy at age 18 during the period when his father was suspended, raising suspicion that the firm may have been created to circumvent regulatory restrictions. The firm's subsequent closure amid ongoing SEC enforcement further damages its credibility. Compounding these issues are inconsistencies in corporate records and the presence of multiple unrelated entities sharing the "Sisu" name, which could confuse due diligence efforts.

Taken together, these findings indicate systemic compliance failures, potential fraud, and serious reputational and financial risks. The ongoing federal litigation and independent investigations underscore the gravity of the situation and warrant cautious treatment of any association with Timothy Overturf or Sisu Capital.

**SKEPTIC:** The investigation findings against Timothy Overturf and Sisu Capital, LLC, while serious in nature, can be viewed with some mitigating context that suggests alternative explanations or benign interpretations. First, the SEC complaint and related allegations remain pending without a final judgment, meaning that the claims have not been proven in court. Allegations of unauthorized trading, unsuitable investments, and failure to disclose disciplinary history are common in regulatory enforcement actions and do not necessarily equate to intentional fraud or misconduct.

Moreover, the involvement of family members, such as Hansueli Overturf, while raising concerns, may reflect a common practice in family-run businesses where roles and responsibilities overlap. The use of limited power of attorney to allow family members to assist in managing accounts is not unusual in wealth management, and the specific terms and controls around these arrangements are not fully disclosed. The timing of firm founding and registration discrepancies could be due to normal business development phases or data inconsistencies rather than deliberate evasion.

Additionally, the presence of multiple unrelated entities sharing the "Sisu" name and multiple individuals named Timothy Overturf with different professional backgrounds introduces potential for confusion and misattribution. Proper due diligence should distinguish these clearly. Finally, performance-based fee structures and owner draws, while flagged as potential conflicts, are standard industry practices when properly disclosed and managed.

In summary, while the allegations warrant thorough investigation, the current evidence includes plausible benign explanations such as pending adjudication, common family business practices, data inconsistencies, and standard industry fee arrangements. These factors suggest caution in drawing definitive conclusions until legal processes are complete.

**PROPONENT:** The investigation findings raise serious concerns due to multiple, corroborated regulatory and legal red flags involving Timothy Overturf and Sisu Capital, LLC. The SEC has filed a civil complaint alleging intentional breaches of fiduciary duty, unauthorized and unsuitable trading, material misrepresentations to clients, and failure to disclose critical disciplinary information about Hansueli Overturf, Timothy’s father. The fact that Hansueli was suspended from investment advisory activities yet continued to provide advice and execute trades through limited power of attorney granted by Timothy suggests deliberate circumvention of regulatory restrictions, indicating premeditated misconduct rather than inadvertent errors.

Moreover, the alleged misuse of client funds to invest in thinly-traded bank stock as part of an undisclosed strategy to advance Timothy’s personal business interests represents a clear conflict of interest and potential self-dealing. The extraction of over $2 million in advisory and performance fees from unsuitable investments further amplifies the financial harm to high net-worth clients, raising the risk of significant client losses. The extended duration of alleged misconduct—spanning more than four years—points to systemic compliance failures and sustained disregard for fiduciary responsibilities.

Additional concerns stem from the timing of Sisu Capital’s founding during Hansueli’s suspension period, suggesting the firm may have been established to enable continued advisory activities by a suspended individual through a family member. The presence of multiple ongoing investigations, including by a private law firm, and the firm’s eventual closure under regulatory pressure, compound reputational and operational risks. Taken together, these findings warrant serious scrutiny and caution, as they reveal a pattern of regulatory evasion, conflicts of interest, and client harm that undermine trust in the individuals and entities involved.

**SKEPTIC:** While the allegations against Timothy Overturf and Sisu Capital, LLC are serious and currently under regulatory and legal scrutiny, several factors suggest that the findings may not definitively indicate intentional wrongdoing. First, the SEC complaint is a civil enforcement action that remains pending, with no final judgment rendered. Allegations such as unauthorized trading and failure to disclose disciplinary history, while concerning, could stem from compliance misunderstandings or administrative oversights rather than deliberate fraud.

The involvement of Hansueli Overturf, Timothy’s father, who was suspended during parts of the relevant period, complicates the situation but also raises the possibility that family business dynamics and informal arrangements contributed to regulatory lapses without malicious intent. Limited power of attorney arrangements are common in family wealth management, and the specific terms and controls around these may not be fully detailed in the complaint, leaving room for benign explanations.

Additionally, inconsistencies in founding dates and multiple individuals named Timothy Overturf with different professional backgrounds suggest some data confusion that could have inflated perceived risks. The presence of multiple unrelated entities named "Sisu" further underscores the need for careful differentiation to avoid conflating unrelated issues.

Finally, performance-based fees and the targeting of high net-worth clients are standard industry practices that, while potentially incentivizing risk-taking, do not inherently imply misconduct. Given the ongoing nature of litigation and investigations, these findings should be viewed as allegations subject to defense and clarification rather than proven violations.

Additionally, he received a Desist and Refrain Order from the California Commissioner of Business Oversight on August 11, 2011 for violations of Corporations Code section 25401 related to misleading statements in securities sales. FINRA also suspended him for one year and fined him $10,000 effective December 19, 2011 for engaging in undisclosed business activities while employed at Raymond James. This extensive pattern of regulatory and criminal issues spanning nearly two decades demonstrates a chronic inability to comply with securities regulations, making Timothy's decision to involve him in Sisu Capital operations particularly egregious.",
