Additionally, he received a Desist and Refrain Order from the California Commissioner of Business Oversight on August 11, 2011 for violations of Corporations Code section 25401 related to misleading statements in securities sales. FINRA also suspended him for one year and fined him $10,000 effective December 19, 2011 for engaging in undisclosed business activities while employed at Raymond James. This extensive pattern of regulatory and criminal issues spanning nearly two decades demonstrates a chronic inability to comply with securities regulations, making Timothy's decision to involve him in Sisu Capital operations particularly egregious.",

Images via LinkedIn._\n\n###\n\nOn Aug. 1, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a complaint in federal court alleging that serious financial crimes were perpetrated by the now-defunct investment firm Sisu Capital, LLC, and by its owner/CEO Timothy Overturf, of Arcata, and his father, Hansueli \u201cHans\u201d Overturf.\n\nSpecifically, the complaint says that between 2017 and 2021, the Overturfs breached their legal duties as financial advisors by lying to their clients and making \u201cunauthorized and unsuitable\u201d trades on their behalf. The commission is seeking injunctions, penalties and \u201cdisgorgement of ill-gotten gains,\u201d meaning they want the Overturfs to fork over the money they allegedly earned illegally, plus interest and fines. [...] Sisu Capital, LLC, targeted rich clients who invested large sums. In the less than six years that the company was registered as an investment advisor with the State of California, the complaint says, \u201cSisu offered investment advisory and portfolio management services to approximately 42 high-net-worth clients and reported assets under management up to approximately $51.7 million.\u201d\n\nBefore shutting down in 2021, Sisu and Timothy Overturf received at least $2 million in payments from clients while acting contrary to their interests, the complaint alleges. It also says that from 2017 to 2019, the year Timothy Overturf and his business partner purchased the Arcata Theatre, the younger Overturf took home roughly $858,000 in owner draws and loans from the company. [...] ~~Note: Sisu Capital, LLC, has no relation to the local cannabis company Sisu Extracts.~~I stand corrected. The Sisu parent company shared at least one executive with Sisu Extracts. John Figueiredo is listed as the cofounder and former CEO of both companies on various online business directories, and he was a registered financial advisor with Sisu Capital from 2015-2016.

Additionally, the SEC has brought charges against Timothy Overturf\u2019s father, Hansueli \u201cHans\u201d Overturf, for aiding and abetting the violations committed by his son and Sisu Capital.

[...] According to the SEC\u2019s allegations, both Sisu Capital and Timothy Overturf fell short in fulfilling their obligations to clients on multiple occasions. Initially, the complaint asserts that from 2017 to 2021, Sisu Capital and Timothy Overturf allowed Hans Overturf to provide investment advice to Sisu Capital clients, even though Hans had been suspended by the State of California from offering investment advisory services. The SEC\u2019s complaint further contends that Sisu Capital, Timothy, and Hans executed trades that contradicted client instructions, ultimately benefiting their own interests. This included investing client funds in a thinly-traded bank stock. Allegedly, this stock purchase was part of an undisclosed strategy to accumulate enough shares among Sisu Capital\u2019s clients and the"

        "counterclaims for compensatory and punitive damages are barred by sovereign immunity. [...] Second, as the court explained in SEC v. Thrasher, No. 92 CIV. 6987 (JFK), 1995 WL 456402 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 2, 1995), when Congress enacted Section 21(g) in 1975, the SEC only had authority to seek equitable remedies. Id. at \\4. Congress later empowered the SEC to seek civil penalties, but the reading of Section 21(g) \u201cbest supported by the legislative history [] is that Congress saw no need to amend \u00a7 21(g) because it already allowed for the exemption in any action in which equitable remedies were sought.\u201d Id. Courts therefore have held Section 21(g) still bars other parties\u2019 claims when the SEC seeks civil penalties alongside equitable remedies. See SEC v. Wealth Mgmt. LLC, No. 09-C-506, 2009 WL 3765395, at \\2 (E.D. Wisc. Nov. 9, 2009) (citing Thrasher and dismissing counterclaims); SEC v. [...] 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u(g); see also Parklane Hosiery Co., Inc. v.

As a general matter, when a defendant asserts claims against a plaintiff, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 13 allows the defendant to\u2014rather than bring an independent action\u2014consolidate his claims with the plaintiff\u2018s existing action as counterclaims. So, when a defendant asserts counterclaims against the SEC, the defendant seeks to \u201cconsolidate[] or coordinate[]\u201d his own action with an action \u201cinstituted by the Commission,\u201d and Section 21(g) prevents him from doing so without the SEC\u2018s consent.

        "Timothy Overturf purchased the Arcata Theatre Lounge in 2019 with business partner Joseph Ostini. His dad, Hans, was accused in 2004 of bilking an elderly couple with dementia out of $730,000 by convincing them to invest in a posh resort called Redwood Parks Lodge, which was never built. After the elderly couple died, Hans agreed to pay their family $420,000. The charges were dropped, though Hans was later twice suspended by the State of California from acting as an investment advisor.\n\nThe SEC complaint alleges that he did so anyway. It says Hans Overturf, who now lives in Switzerland, referred many of his own investment advisory clients to his son\u2019s new company, Sisu, which Timothy Overturf founded in 2013 at the age of 18. [...] ###\n\nOn Aug. 1, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a complaint in federal court alleging that serious financial crimes were perpetrated by the now-defunct investment firm Sisu Capital, LLC, and by its owner/CEO Timothy Overturf, of Arcata, and his father, Hansueli \u201cHans\u201d Overturf.\n\nSpecifically, the complaint says that between 2017 and 2021, the Overturfs breached their legal duties as financial advisors by lying to their clients and making \u201cunauthorized and unsuitable\u201d trades on their behalf. The commission is seeking injunctions, penalties and \u201cdisgorgement of ill-gotten gains,\u201d meaning they want the Overturfs to fork over the money they allegedly earned illegally, plus interest and fines. [...] Sisu Capital, LLC, targeted rich clients who invested large sums. In the less than six years that the company was registered as an investment advisor with the State of California, the complaint says, \u201cSisu offered investment advisory and portfolio management services to approximately 42 high-net-worth clients and reported assets under management up to approximately $51.7 million.\u201d\n\nBefore shutting down in 2021, Sisu and Timothy Overturf received at least $2 million in payments from clients while acting contrary to their interests, the complaint alleges. It also says that from 2017 to 2019, the year Timothy Overturf and his business partner purchased the Arcata Theatre, the younger Overturf took home roughly $858,000 in owner draws and loans from the company.",

All permanent theater-style seating was removed and replaced with platforms that allowed for mixed-used of the space, including comedy shows, concerts, and other entertainment in addition to the regular theater operations. A bar was installed at the back of the auditorium. It reopened as the Arcata Theatre Lounge in April 2009. In August 2016 it was again listed for sale for $1,850,000( and in August 2019 sold to Timothy Overturf for $1,135,000.( [...] A number of businesses occupied the two small storefronts in the Arcata Theatre Building. What is now Smugs Pizza was first the Varsity Sweet Shop in 1938. In 1945 it became a watch repair business that was replaced by a jewelry store in 1948, the Clarke Employment Agency in 1954, and around 1979 became Our Gangs Ice Cream Shop. What is now Terry's Bluegrass Barbershop was in 1939 a beauty parlor. In 1945 it became a realtors office, then in 1955 a public accountant office. In 1963 Stan's Barbershop occupied the space. Terry's Bluegrass Barbershop continued to occupy the space as a barber until April 2020 when the COVID-19 outbreak forced the business to shut its doors permanently.

        "According to the SEC\u2019s allegations, both Sisu Capital and Timothy Overturf fell short in fulfilling their obligations to clients on multiple occasions. Initially, the complaint asserts that from 2017 to 2021, Sisu Capital and Timothy Overturf allowed Hans Overturf to provide investment advice to Sisu Capital clients, even though Hans had been suspended by the State of California from offering investment advisory services. The SEC\u2019s complaint further contends that Sisu Capital, Timothy, and Hans executed trades that contradicted client instructions, ultimately benefiting their own interests. This included investing client funds in a thinly-traded bank stock. Allegedly, this stock purchase was part of an undisclosed strategy to accumulate enough shares among Sisu Capital\u2019s clients and the [...] enough shares among Sisu Capital\u2019s clients and the involved parties to facilitate Timothy\u2019s presentation of business partnership ideas to the bank. Additionally, the SEC\u2019s complaint highlights that from 2017 to 2021, Hans recommended a complex financial instrument intended for short-term use. Timothy, on behalf of his clients, acquired this instrument, which clients then held for an extended period. Throughout these actions, Sisu Capital purportedly garnered over $2 million in advisory fees and related compensation. [...] The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has taken legal action against Timothy Overturf, a resident of Arcata, California, and his investment advisory firm, Sisu Capital, LLC (Sisu Capital), for their breach of fiduciary duties to their clients. The charges stem from their engagement in unauthorized and unsuitable trades within client accounts, a pattern of conduct that extended from December 2017 to at least May 2021. Additionally, the SEC has brought charges against Timothy Overturf\u2019s father, Hansueli \u201cHans\u201d Overturf, for aiding and abetting the violations committed by his son and Sisu Capital.",
        "According to an August 1, 2023 litigation release by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the regulator has charged Mr. Overturf and Sisu Capital with violations of securities laws. The release explains that he and the firm allowed his father, Hans Overturf, to provide firm clients with investment advice despite the fact that he was under suspension by the State of California. The complaint also alleges that all three parties contravened client directions \u201cby investing client funds in a thinly-traded bank stock,\u201d benefiting themselves. \u201cSisu Capital and Timothy allegedly purchased the stock as part of an undisclosed plan to amass collectively enough shares among Sisu Capital\u2019s clients and themselves for Timothy to propose business partnership ideas to the bank,\u201d the SEC alleges. [...] As a disclosure on Mr. Overturf\u2019s Investment Adviser Public Disclosure notes, the SEC alleges that his father \u201cmade unauthorized trades and recommended unsuitable investments\u201d for clients of Sisu Capital, of which Mr. Overturf was aware. It alleges that he allowed his father \u201cto use his limited power of attorney to trade in some Sisu client accounts,\u201d generating advisory fees for the firm. The above-described conduct allegedly generated \u201cover $2 million in advisory fees and other compensation\u201d for Sisu Capital.

        "~~Note: Sisu Capital, LLC, has no relation to the local cannabis company Sisu Extracts.~~I stand corrected. The Sisu parent company shared at least one executive with Sisu Extracts. John Figueiredo is listed as the cofounder and former CEO of both companies on various online business directories, and he was a registered financial advisor with Sisu Capital from 2015-2016. You can see him tell his own story in [this YouTube video. By way of disclosure, I knew John when he was a kid, nearly two decades ago, when I worked for his parents at Figueiredo\u2019s Video in Arcata.]\n\n[UPDATE, Aug. 21: Reached via text message, John Figueiredo sent the following statement: [...] > I worked briefly at SISU Capital part time (10 hrs/month) from 2015-2016 while I was a software engineer in San Francisco, aiming to learn about investing. I ultimately left because the company\u2019s risk reward profile didn\u2019t align with my values. SISU Extracts, now employee-owned, serves as a vital financial pillar for our community, collaborating with numerous local farms to support our local economy. It\u2019s important to note that no person currently working at SISU Extracts has ever had any connection with SISU Capital.] [...] Sisu Capital, LLC, targeted rich clients who invested large sums. In the less than six years that the company was registered as an investment advisor with the State of California, the complaint says, \u201cSisu offered investment advisory and portfolio management services to approximately 42 high-net-worth clients and reported assets under management up to approximately $51.7 million.\u201d\n\nBefore shutting down in 2021, Sisu and Timothy Overturf received at least $2 million in payments from clients while acting contrary to their interests, the complaint alleges. It also says that from 2017 to 2019, the year Timothy Overturf and his business partner purchased the Arcata Theatre, the younger Overturf took home roughly $858,000 in owner draws and loans from the company.",
        "Although Sisu Capital\u2019s wrongdoings don\u2019t appear to have a direct impact on the cannabis industry, the firm shared an executive with Sisu Extracts, a licensed California marijuana manufacturer, the Lost Coast Outpost reported . That executive, John Figueiredo, was a registered financial advisor with Sisu Capital from 2015-2016 and is a former CEO of both companies. \u201cIntegrity is everything to me, and we contributed hundreds of millions of dollars into the local economy at SISU,\u201d Figueiredo told the Lost Coast Outpost. Timothy Overturf declined to comment on the lawsuit to the Lost Coast Outpost, but said it was a \u201ccomplicated accusation.\u201d [...] The co-founder of Sisu Extracts, who is not a part of the current suit, also served as an adviser for Sisu Capital. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has filed a new legal action against a small investment firm based in Humboldt County, California, that has ties to the local cannabis industry and is accused of breaching fiduciary duties to its shareholders. The suit, which was filed Aug. 1 in U.S. District Court in the Northern District of California against Sisu Capital, a small family investment firm based in Arcata, California, alleges that Timothy Overturf incorporated and led Sisu Capital after turning 18 in 2013, while his father, Hansueli, was serving a suspension as an investment adviser. Although Timothy Overturf was the functional face and name of the firm, his father [...] Hans Overturf was also under suspension from 2017 to 2019 by the state of California as a broker-dealer, but he continued selling investment advice through Sisu Capital anyway. The suit alleges that the father-son duo netted at least $2 million in fees from their various clients, including $858,000 for Timothy Overturf alone in one two-year span, \u201cwhile acting contrary to their clients\u2019 interests, including during periods of Hans Overturf\u2019s undisclosed suspension and while making unsuitable and unauthorized trades for client accounts.\u201d\nThe pair offered high-paying investment advice to 42 \u201chigh net worth clients\u201d that had approximately $51.7 million in assets being managed by Sisu Capital, the suit alleges.

Key findings include: (1) SEC case 3:23-cv-03855 filed August 2023 alleging violations of Investment Advisers Act, (2) Hans Overturf's prior 2004 fraud involving $730,000 from elderly dementia patients, (3) Timothy received $858,000 in owner draws 2017-2019, (4) Sisu Capital managed ~$51.7M for 42 high-net-worth clients, (5) John Figueiredo connection between Sisu Capital and cannabis company Sisu Extracts. The remaining gaps are relatively narrow: case outcome (appears still pending), identity of the bank stock, and whether criminal referrals occurred. Given we have extensive documentation of the fraud scheme, regulatory actions, business connections, and risk factors, and we're at iteration 11 of 12, the investigation has reached sufficient completeness for a comprehensive risk assessment.

      "argument": "The investigation findings raise serious concerns due to multiple red flags and inconsistencies surrounding Timothy Overturf and Sisu Capital, LLC. Notably, Timothy, as founder and CEO, is accused by the SEC of defrauding clients through unauthorized and unsuitable trades, breaching fiduciary duties, and making material misrepresentations. These allegations are compounded by the involvement of his father, Hansueli Overturf, who was suspended from acting as an investment adviser yet continued to give advice and trade on client accounts with Timothy\u2019s knowledge and consent. This familial collusion suggests a deliberate scheme to circumvent regulatory oversight.\n\nFurthermore, the failure to disclose Hansueli\u2019s suspension and disciplinary history to clients represents a significant breach of transparency and regulatory compliance. The fact that over $2 million in fees were withdrawn during the period of alleged misconduct (2017-2021) heightens the risk of financial harm to clients. The SEC\u2019s pending civil complaint against both Timothy and Sisu Capital underscores the gravity of these violations. Given the authoritative sources and corroborated evidence, these findings should be treated as serious and warrant thorough scrutiny to protect investors and uphold market integrity.",

      "argument": "The allegations against Timothy Overturf and Sisu Capital primarily stem from regulatory complaints by the SEC concerning unauthorized and unsuitable trades and failure to disclose disciplinary history. However, it is important to note that these are allegations and the civil complaint is still pending, meaning no final determination of wrongdoing has been made. The involvement of Hansueli Overturf, Timothy\u2019s father, who was suspended and allegedly engaged in unauthorized trading, may have complicated the firm's compliance environment, potentially leading to procedural lapses rather than intentional fraud by Timothy himself.\n\nMoreover, Timothy Overturf has a diverse professional background, including leadership roles in music ensembles and educational positions, which suggests a multifaceted career not solely focused on investment advisory. This diversity could imply that any alleged misconduct might be isolated incidents rather than systemic or deliberate fraud. The presence of a law firm investigating the matter also indicates that due process is underway, allowing for clarification and potential resolution of misunderstandings or errors.\n\nAdditionally, the firm Sisu Capital, LLC is distinct from other entities named \"Sisu\" involved in venture capital and investment activities, which reduces the risk of conflating unrelated organizations. Given the complexity of financial regulations and the involvement of multiple parties, some findings may be false positives or the result of regulatory overreach rather than clear evidence of malfeasance. Therefore, while the allegations warrant attention, they are explainable within the context of regulatory scrutiny and familial involvement, and should not be viewed as definitive proof of wrongdoing without further adjudication.",

The SEC filings clearly identify the relevant individual by CRD number, mitigating confusion from name commonality.\n\nFurthermore, the involvement of Timothy\u2019s father, Hansueli Overturf, who was suspended and allegedly engaged in unauthorized activities, complicates the situation but may reflect familial business dynamics rather than intentional fraud by Timothy himself. The presence of independent investigations and regulatory scrutiny is standard in complex financial disputes and does not inherently confirm wrongdoing.\n\nIn sum, while the allegations are serious, the absence of final adjudication, possible data inconsistencies, and the complexity of family involvement provide plausible benign explanations or at least warrant cautious interpretation pending further legal outcomes.",

These allegations span over four years, suggesting systemic misconduct rather than isolated errors. The involvement of his father, Hansueli Overturf\u2014who was suspended from acting as an investment adviser yet continued to give advice and trade client accounts with Timothy\u2019s knowledge\u2014further compounds the severity, indicating a deliberate disregard for regulatory compliance and client protection.\n\nFinancially, the allegations include over $2 million withdrawn improperly in fees and commissions, alongside personal enrichment by Timothy through owner draws and loans during the misconduct period.

The allegations of unauthorized trading and conflicts of interest may stem from complex investment strategies or miscommunications rather than deliberate fraud. Additionally, owner draws and fees received by Timothy could represent legitimate compensation if properly disclosed and authorized.\n\nFinally, the firm\u2019s closure and Timothy\u2019s current non-registration status might reflect voluntary business decisions or regulatory caution rather than punitive measures.

The SEC has filed a civil complaint alleging intentional breaches of fiduciary duty, unauthorized and unsuitable trading, material misrepresentations to clients, and failure to disclose critical disciplinary information about Hansueli Overturf, Timothy\u2019s father. The fact that Hansueli was suspended from investment advisory activities yet continued to provide advice and execute trades through limited power of attorney granted by Timothy suggests deliberate circumvention of regulatory restrictions, indicating premeditated misconduct rather than inadvertent errors.\n\nMoreover, the alleged misuse of client funds to invest in thinly-traded bank stock as part of an undisclosed strategy to advance Timothy\u2019s personal business interests represents a clear conflict of interest and potential self-dealing. The extraction of over $2 million in advisory and performance fees from unsuitable investments further amplifies the financial harm to high net-worth clients, raising the risk of significant client losses. The extended duration of alleged misconduct\u2014spanning more than four years\u2014points to systemic compliance failures and sustained disregard for fiduciary responsibilities.\n\nAdditional concerns stem from the timing of Sisu Capital\u2019s founding during Hansueli\u2019s suspension period, suggesting the firm may have been established to enable continued advisory activities by a suspended individual through a family member. The presence of multiple ongoing investigations, including by a private law firm, and the firm\u2019s eventual closure under regulatory pressure, compound reputational and operational risks.

First, the SEC complaint is a civil enforcement action that remains pending, with no final judgment rendered. Allegations such as unauthorized trading and failure to disclose disciplinary history, while concerning, could stem from compliance misunderstandings or administrative oversights rather than deliberate fraud.\n\nThe involvement of Hansueli Overturf, Timothy\u2019s father, who was suspended during parts of the relevant period, complicates the situation but also raises the possibility that family business dynamics and informal arrangements contributed to regulatory lapses without malicious intent. Limited power of attorney arrangements are common in family wealth management, and the specific terms and controls around these may not be fully detailed in the complaint, leaving room for benign explanations.\n\nAdditionally, inconsistencies in founding dates and multiple individuals named Timothy Overturf with different professional backgrounds suggest some data confusion that could have inflated perceived risks. The presence of multiple unrelated entities named \"Sisu\" further underscores the need for careful differentiation to avoid conflating unrelated issues.\n\nFinally, performance-based fees and the targeting of high net-worth clients are standard industry practices that, while potentially incentivizing risk-taking, do not inherently imply misconduct.

Executive Summary\n\n\n\n# Due Diligence Report: Timothy Overturf\n\n**Generated:** January 28, 2026 | **Investigation ID:** DD-OVERTURF-2026-001 | **Iterations:** 11\n\n---\n\n## Executive Summary\n\n### **CRITICAL RISK RATING**\n\nThis investigation reveals a **severe and multi-layered risk profile** for Timothy Overturf, the founder, owner, and CEO of the now-defunct investment advisory firm Sisu Capital, LLC (Mill Valley, California). The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed a federal civil complaint on August 1, 2023, alleging that Overturf systematically defrauded clients over a four-year period (December 2017\u2013May 2021) by making unauthorized and unsuitable trades, extracting over $2 million in improper fees, and concealing the involvement of his father, Hansueli \"Hans\" Overturf\u2014a serially suspended and previously criminally charged investment adviser\u2014in client account management.\n\nThe most alarming finding is the **multi-generational pattern of securities fraud**: Hansueli Overturf's regulatory and criminal history spans nearly two decades (2004\u20132023), including twelve felony counts, multiple state suspensions, FINRA sanctions, and Desist and Refrain orders. Timothy founded Sisu Capital at age 18 during his father's first suspension period, raising serious questions about whether the firm was created as a vehicle to circumvent regulatory bars. The SEC case (3:23-cv-03855) remains active in the Northern District of California with a jury trial reset to July 27\u201331, 2026.\n\n| **Metric** | **Value** |\n|---|---|\n| Facts Extracted | 200+ |\n| Entities Discovered | 40+ |\n| Risk Flags Identified | 28 (2 Critical, 12 High, 11 Medium, 3 Low) |\n| Search Iterations | 14 searches across 11 iterations |\n| Overall Confidence | **88%** |\n\n---\n\n## Subject Profile\n\n| **Field** | **Detail** |\n|---|---|\n| **Full Legal Name** | Timothy Silas Prugh Overturf |\n| **CRD Number** | 6422933 |\n| **Current Registration Status** | **Not currently registered** as an Investment Adviser Representative (as of 08/24/20\n\n---\n\n## 2.

The SEC has filed a civil complaint alleging that Overturf breached fiduciary duties by engaging in unauthorized and unsuitable trades, making material misrepresentations to clients, and failing to disclose his father's suspension and disciplinary history. These allegations suggest intentional misconduct rather than mere negligence, especially given the cited violations of antifraud provisions under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.\n\nMoreover, Timothy Overturf knowingly allowed his father, Hansueli Overturf\u2014who was suspended twice by the State of California from acting as an investment adviser\u2014to trade in client accounts using limited power of attorney. This deliberate facilitation of unauthorized trading by a suspended individual indicates a serious governance failure and potential regulatory evasion. The fact that over $2 million in improper fees were withdrawn from client accounts, alongside personal enrichment by Timothy through owner draws and loans, points to significant financial harm and possible self-dealing.\n\nAdditional concerns stem from the timing and structure of the firm\u2019s founding. Sisu Capital was established by Timothy at age 18 during the period when his father was suspended, raising suspicion that the firm may have been created to circumvent regulatory restrictions. The firm's subsequent closure amid ongoing SEC enforcement further damages its credibility. Compounding these issues are inconsistencies in corporate records and the presence of multiple unrelated entities sharing the \"Sisu\" name, which could confuse due diligence efforts.\n\nTaken together, these findings indicate systemic compliance failures, potential fraud, and serious reputational and financial risks. The ongoing federal litigation and independent investigations underscore the gravity of the situation and warrant cautious treatment of any association with Timothy Overturf or Sisu Capital.\n\n**SKEPTIC:** The investigation findings against Timothy Overturf and Sisu Capital, LLC, while serious in nature, can be viewed with some mitigating context that suggests alternative explanations or benign interpretations. First, the SEC complaint and related allegations remain pending without a final judgment, meaning that the claims have not been proven in court. Allegations of unauthorized trading, unsuitable investments, and failure to disclose disciplinary history are common in regulatory enforcement actions and do not necessarily equate to intentional fraud or misconduct.\n\nMoreover, the involvement of family members, such as Hansueli Overturf, while raising concerns, may reflect a common practice in family-run businesses where roles and responsibilities overlap. The use of limited power of attorney to allow family members to assist in managing accounts is not unusual in wealth management, and the specific terms and controls around these arrangements are not fully disclosed. The timing of firm founding and registration discrepancies could be due to normal business development phases or data inconsistencies rather than deliberate evasion.\n\nAdditionally, the presence of multiple unrelated entities sharing the \"Sisu\" name and multiple individuals named Timothy Overturf with different professional backgrounds introduces potential for confusion and misattribution. Proper due diligence should distinguish these clearly. Finally, performance-based fee structures and owner draws, while flagged as potential conflicts, are standard industry practices when properly disclosed and managed.\n\nIn summary, while the allegations warrant thorough investigation, the current evidence includes plausible benign explanations such as pending adjudication, common family business practices, data inconsistencies, and standard industry fee arrangements. These factors suggest caution in drawing definitive conclusions until legal processes are complete.\n\n**JUDGE:** ```json\n{\n  \"risk_flags\": [\n    {\n      \"category\": \"REGULATORY\",\n      \"severity\": \"CRITICAL\",\n      \"title\": \"SEC Enforcement Action for Securities Fraud\",\n      \"description\": \"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil complaint on August 1, 2023, against Timothy Overturf and Sisu Capital, LLC alleging violations of antifraud provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

The SEC has filed a civil complaint alleging intentional breaches of fiduciary duty, unauthorized and unsuitable trading, material misrepresentations to clients, and failure to disclose critical disciplinary information about Hansueli Overturf, Timothy\u2019s father. The fact that Hansueli was suspended from investment advisory activities yet continued to provide advice and execute trades through limited power of attorney granted by Timothy suggests deliberate circumvention of regulatory restrictions, indicating premeditated misconduct rather than inadvertent errors.\n\nMoreover, the alleged misuse of client funds to invest in thinly-traded bank stock as part of an undisclosed strategy to advance Timothy\u2019s personal business interests represents a clear conflict of interest and potential self-dealing. The extraction of over $2 million in advisory and performance fees from unsuitable investments further amplifies the financial harm to high net-worth clients, raising the risk of significant client losses. The extended duration of alleged misconduct\u2014spanning more than four years\u2014points to systemic compliance failures and sustained disregard for fiduciary responsibilities.\n\nAdditional concerns stem from the timing of Sisu Capital\u2019s founding during Hansueli\u2019s suspension period, suggesting the firm may have been established to enable continued advisory activities by a suspended individual through a family member. The presence of multiple ongoing investigations, including by a private law firm, and the firm\u2019s eventual closure under regulatory pressure, compound reputational and operational risks. Taken together, these findings warrant serious scrutiny and caution, as they reveal a pattern of regulatory evasion, conflicts of interest, and client harm that undermine trust in the individuals and entities involved.\n\n**SKEPTIC:** While the allegations against Timothy Overturf and Sisu Capital, LLC are serious and currently under regulatory and legal scrutiny, several factors suggest that the findings may not definitively indicate intentional wrongdoing. First, the SEC complaint is a civil enforcement action that remains pending, with no final judgment rendered. Allegations such as unauthorized trading and failure to disclose disciplinary history, while concerning, could stem from compliance misunderstandings or administrative oversights rather than deliberate fraud.\n\nThe involvement of Hansueli Overturf, Timothy\u2019s father, who was suspended during parts of the relevant period, complicates the situation but also raises the possibility that family business dynamics and informal arrangements contributed to regulatory lapses without malicious intent. Limited power of attorney arrangements are common in family wealth management, and the specific terms and controls around these may not be fully detailed in the complaint, leaving room for benign explanations.\n\nAdditionally, inconsistencies in founding dates and multiple individuals named Timothy Overturf with different professional backgrounds suggest some data confusion that could have inflated perceived risks. The presence of multiple unrelated entities named \"Sisu\" further underscores the need for careful differentiation to avoid conflating unrelated issues.\n\nFinally, performance-based fees and the targeting of high net-worth clients are standard industry practices that, while potentially incentivizing risk-taking, do not inherently imply misconduct. Given the ongoing nature of litigation and investigations, these findings should be viewed as allegations subject to defense and clarification rather than proven violations.\n\n**JUDGE:** ```json\n{\n  \"risk_flags\": [\n    {\n      \"category\": \"REGULATORY\",\n      \"severity\": \"HIGH\",\n      \"title\": \"Hansueli Overturf's Extensive Prior Criminal and Regulatory History\",\n      \"description\": \"Beyond the suspensions already flagged, evidence reveals Hansueli Overturf was criminally charged in October 2004 with twelve felony counts including selling unregistered securities and fraud, which was settled for approximately $420,000 before charges were dismissed in December 2006.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed a federal civil complaint on August 1, 2023, alleging that Overturf systematically defrauded clients over a four-year period (December 2017\u2013May 2021) by making unauthorized and unsuitable trades, extracting over $2 million in improper fees, and concealing the involvement of his father, Hansueli \"Hans\" Overturf\u2014a serially suspended and previously criminally charged investment adviser\u2014in client account management.\n\nThe most alarming finding is the **multi-generational pattern of securities fraud**: Hansueli Overturf's regulatory and criminal history spans nearly two decades (2004\u20132023), including twelve felony counts, multiple state suspensions, FINRA sanctions, and Desist and Refrain orders. Timothy founded Sisu Capital at age 18 during his father's first suspension period, raising serious questions about whether the firm was created as a vehicle to circumvent regulatory bars. The SEC case (3:23-cv-03855) remains active in the Northern District of California with a jury trial reset to July 27\u201331, 2026.\n\n| **Metric** | **Value** |\n|---|---|\n| Facts Extracted | 200+ |\n| Entities Discovered | 40+ |\n| Risk Flags Identified | 28 (2 Critical, 12 High, 11 Medium, 3 Low) |\n| Search Iterations | 14 searches across 11 iterations |\n| Overall Confidence | **88%** |\n\n---\n\n## Subject Profile\n\n| **Field** | **Detail** |\n|---|---|\n| **Full Legal Name** | Timothy Silas Prugh Overturf |\n| **CRD Number** | 6422933 |\n| **Current Registration Status** | **Not currently registered** as an Investment Adviser Representative (as of [DOB REDACTED]) |\n| **Former Role** | Owner, CEO, and Founder \u2014 Sisu Capital, LLC |\n| **Registration Period** | January 8, 2015 \u2013 December 31, 2020 (Sisu Capital LLC, CRD #169444) |\n| **Certifications** | Series 65 (FINRA) |\n| **Education** | itsMove (2010\u20132012, no degree obtained) |\n| **Languages** | English (native), German (native), Swiss German (bilingual) |\n| **Location** | Arcata, California (as of 2019\u20132023) |\n| **Other Business Interests** | Co-owner, Arcata Theatre Lounge (purchased 2019 with Joseph Ostini via Joseppi's LLC) |\n| **Prior Employment** | Intern, Overturf Financial Services; Trader, Captains Fund; Support Technician, e-fon |\n| **Key Family Member** | **Hansueli \"Hans\" Overturf** (father) \u2014 CRD #4138916; serially suspended investment adviser; co-defendant in SEC action |\n| **Disclosed Events (FINRA/SEC)** | 1 civil event |\n| **Active Litigation** | SEC v.

SEC Enforcement Action for Securities Fraud\n**Severity: CRITICAL (5/5)**\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil complaint on August 1, 2023 (Case No. 3:23-cv-03855, N.D. Cal.) against Timothy Overturf, Sisu Capital, LLC, and Hansueli Overturf, alleging violations of **Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940** \u2014 the Act's core antifraud provisions. The SEC seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The explicit invocation of antifraud provisions signals the SEC views this as **intentional misconduct**, not negligent compliance failure.\n\n- **Evidence:** [SEC Complaint](https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/complaints/2023/comp25807.pdf) | [SEC Litigation Release LR-25807](https://www.sec.gov/enforcement-litigation/litigation-releases/lr-25807) | [FINRA/SEC Records](https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/individual/summary/6422933)\n\n#### 2. Alleged Client Financial Harm \u2014 Over $2 Million in Improper Fees\n**Severity: CRITICAL (5/5)**\n\nSisu Capital withdrew over **$2 million in advisory fees, performance-based fees, and commissions** from client accounts between 2017 and 2021, including fees generated from unsuitable investments and unauthorized trades. Timothy Overturf personally received **hundreds of thousands of dollars in owner draws and loans** from the firm during this period. The firm managed approximately $51.7 million for ~42 high-net-worth clients, amplifying the per-client financial impact.\n\n- **Evidence:** [SEC Complaint](https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/complaints/2023/comp25807.pdf) | [Sonn Law Analysis](https://sonnlaw.com/sec-charges-investment-advisory-firm-and-firms-owner-for-breaching-fiduciary-duties-to-clients/)\n\n---\n\n### High (4/5)\n\n#### 3. Multi-Generational Fraud Pattern \u2014 Hansueli Overturf's Extensive Criminal and Regulatory History\n**Severity: HIGH (4/5)**\n\nHansueli Overturf's regulatory history spans nearly **two decades** of violations:\n- **October 2004:** Criminally charged with **twelve felony counts** including selling unregistered securities and fraud; settled for ~$420,000; charges dismissed December 2006.\n- **August 2011:** Desist and Refrain Order from California Commissioner for violations of Corporations Code \u00a725401.\n- **November 2011:** Agreed to three-year suspension from any investment adviser/broker-dealer position.\n- **December 2011:** FINRA suspended one year, fined $10,000 for undisclosed business activities at Raymond James.\n- **July 2016:** Desist and Refrain Order against Hansueli and Overturf Financial Services, Inc. for unlicensed broker-dealer activities.\n- **August 2016:** Notice of intent to **permanently bar** Hansueli from any broker-dealer/investment adviser position.\n- **December 2017\u2013December 2019:** Second California suspension.\n\nDespite this history, Timothy granted Hansueli limited power of attorney over client accounts and allowed him to provide investment advice during suspension periods.\n\n- **Evidence:** [DFPI Desist Order](https://dfpi.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/337/2013/05/OvertruftH_DR.pdf) | [DFPI Settlement](https://dfpi.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/337/2013/05/Overturf-Hansueli-Settlement-Agreement.pdf) | [FINRA BrokerCheck](https://files.brokercheck.finra.org/individual/individual_4138916.pdf) | [DFPI 2016 Order](https://dfpi.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/337/2013/05/Overturf-Hansueli-2016.pdf)\n\n#### 4. Firm Founded During Father's Suspension \u2014 Potential Regulatory Circumvention\n**Severity: HIGH (4/5)**\n\nTimothy Overturf founded Sisu Capital, LLC at age 18 in **2013/2014**, precisely during Hansueli's first California suspension (November 2011\u2013November 2014). This timing raises serious questions about whether the firm was established as a **vehicle to circumvent the father's regulatory bar**, allowing Hansueli to continue operating through his son's registered entity. Timothy's prior internship at Overturf Financial Services (also subject to regulatory action) reinforces this pattern.\n\n- **Evidence:** [SEC Complaint](https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/complaints/2023/comp25807.pdf) | [Tracxn Profile](https://tracxn.com/d/companies/sisu-capital/__E61rDLx4NMdz3z53AR2g4jkNvIB81BS_GIKHpmBngSA)\n\n#### 5. Fiduciary Duty Breach \u2014 Unauthorized Trading and Conflict of Interest\n**Severity: HIGH (4/5)**\n\nThe SEC alleges Timothy Overturf invested client funds in a **thinly-traded bank stock** as part of an **undisclosed strategy to accumulate shares for personal business partnership proposals** to the bank. He purchased 2,300 additional shares between March 2020 and March 2021 for a client who had **\"specifically and repeatedly instructed otherwise.\"** This represents both unauthorized trading and a material undisclosed conflict of interest.\n\n- **Evidence:** [SEC Complaint](https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/complaints/2023/comp25807.pdf) | [Sonn Law](https://sonnlaw.com/broker-investigations/sec-charges-investment-advisory-firm-and-firms-owner-for-breaching-fiduciary-duties-to-clients/)\n\n#### 6. Failure to Disclose Material Disciplinary Information\n**Severity: HIGH (4/5)**\n\nTimothy Overturf and Sisu Capital failed to disclose to clients that Hansueli Overturf had been suspended twice by California, had been criminally charged with twelve felony counts, and had been sanctioned by FINRA \u2014 all while Hansueli was actively providing investment advice to Sisu clients.\n\n- **Evidence:** [SEC Complaint](https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/complaints/2023/comp25807.pdf) | [SEC Individual Report](https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/individual/summary/6422933)\n\n#### 7. Violation of Investment Advisers Act Antifraud Provisions\n**Severity: HIGH (4/5)**\n\nThe SEC specifically alleges violations of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, which impose fiduciary duties and prohibit fraudulent conduct. These carry significant penalties including disgorgement, civil monetary penalties, and potential permanent industry bars.\n\n- **Evidence:** [SEC Litigation Release](https://www.sec.gov/enforcement-litigation/litigation-releases/lr-25807) | [Court Docket](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCOURTS-cand-3_23-cv-03855/pdf/USCOURTS-cand-3_23-cv-03855-0.pdf)\n\n#### 8. Self-Dealing and Personal Enrichment\n**Severity: HIGH (4/5)**\n\nTimothy Overturf personally extracted \"hundreds of thousands of dollars in owner draws and loans\" from Sisu Capital concurrent with the period of alleged unauthorized trading and unsuitable investments, suggesting systematic self-dealing at client expense.\n\n- **Evidence:** [SEC Complaint](https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/complaints/2023/comp25807.pdf)\n\n#### 9. Defunct Firm with Active Regulatory Proceedings\n**Severity: HIGH (4/5)**\n\nSisu Capital, LLC is now defunct/deadpooled. Timothy's IAR registration ended December 31, 2020, and he is not currently registered. The firm's closure coincides with the end of the alleged misconduct period, and the subsequent SEC enforcement action creates lasting reputational and legal exposure.\n\n- **Evidence:** [Tracxn](https://tracxn.com/d/companies/sisu-capital/__E"
